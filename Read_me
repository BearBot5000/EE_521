Final Project

2) Shor’s algorithm for factorization

     Explain quantum Fourier transform theoretically and then implement in qiskit

     Then, explain factorization – discuss the theory and an implementation of all steps.

Written report and  a 20 minute long video presentation (please be visible on the camera).



Format for project:

Please send your project topic to TA Yiren Wang by Wednesday (14th of this month).

Two students per group  (Please do not mix EE 421 and 521 students)

Use figure number and your favorite method for technical/scientific referencing.

Qiskit code

Submit a clearly commented Qiskit code if your group’s work involved qiskit

Include comments in your code to explain what is being done theoretically

Video

Should be between 19 and 23 minutes. Not more, not less.

Word file

Introduction

Technical discussion

If quantum gates are used, explain their operation

Where is this technologically?  (Don’t spend too much time on this.)

Progress made in the last three years

Bottlenecks to technological realization that should be overcome
